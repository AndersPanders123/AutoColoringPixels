This is my Coloring Pixels Cheat Script that can semi do everything for you so that you dont have to actually play the game :)

To use this program to its fullest you should download the modding software AzzaMods.
With that software you make make it auto select the right color and you can also tweak the size of the the paint brush. 
When i use it for mye self i usually put the brush to 30 hight and width, if you put any more your game migth start lagging and could crash. 

You also need to change the speed of the mouse when going from side to side becouse in larger pictures it has to go slower or else it will jump over pixels without coloring them.
You can also change the point of the screen when you want the mouse to go to the top again.

Press ESC to close the program when you have it activated
Press | to start the program after you started it from VScode.

You can change the keybindes to what ever you like if you want to, I just use what i think is the convinient.

Please make your own and test and add to mine or take from mine and use on your own.
Have fun useing my Coloring Pixels Cheat Script !!
